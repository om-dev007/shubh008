# Practice Web Project

This project is built for **practice and learning**, not as a personal portfolio. I designed this site to experiment with modern CSS and basic JavaScript concepts.

##  Live Demo  
Access the live version [here](https://shubh008.netlify.app/).

##  Purpose  
I created this site purely to practice frontend skills. The project links and contact section contain my real links, but the name and photo are placeholders. The focus is on mastering CSS (variables, Flexbox, Grid, responsiveness) and basic JavaScript.

##  Key Features & What I Learned  
- **CSS Variables** – Used for centralized theming (colors, spacing, fonts).  
- **Flexbox & CSS Grid** – Built flexible and robust layout structures.  
- **Responsive Design** – Implemented mobile-first design with media queries for various devices.  
- **Basic JavaScript** – Added simple interactivity like form validation, smooth scrolling, or dynamic class toggling.  

### Sections Breakdown  
- **Navigation Bar** – Links scroll smoothly to Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact sections.  
- **About** – Placeholder name and photo, with a short intro explaining the purpose.  
- **Skills** – Displayed skills using icons or badges, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, etc.  
- **Projects** –  
  - **NoteVault** – A simple note-taking web app with file uploads (images/PDFs).  
  - **Portfolio Demo** – A layout template showcasing skills, about, and contact segments.  
- **Contact** – Social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram) and a contact form (Name, Email, Message) with basic JS validation.
